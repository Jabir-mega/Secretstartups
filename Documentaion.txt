PROJECT JOURNEY 
phase 1: The project was first started with small idea but has been growing ever since. 
Started as a pure front-end (design) with few pages i.e about, contact, index & shop and a few pictures as products no back end and no login or authentication whatsoever 
that side of the project we used basic html , tailwind css and embedded js for mobile interactivity 

with that phase done we moved on to adding user authentication using flask as a core component, we initialized the flask app and set routes within the app.py file where we also initialized the the database through it and created login & register pages and set their views the register and login knowldge works but still need a few tweaks to perfect it yet 
 aim : make it in a way that when the webpage is loaded first the login and register links are still showed in the navbar but after registering it redirects to login page and ater loging in it redirects to the home page and login & register buttons are disabled with a user icon showed near the cart link showing usernmae of user
